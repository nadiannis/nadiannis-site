This is the first time I've written something more personal on my website. It's a reflection on the past year. While it's a bit late to share these thoughts at the end of January 2025, I still want to put them out there.

Here's my takeaways from 2024:

1. Wanting to make others happy is good. But assuming they will enjoy the same things we do is selfish. We can't make others happy without asking what makes them happy. Just having good intentions isn't enough.
2. I can prepare thoroughly and put in my best effort to achieve something, but that doesn't guarantee I'll reach my goal. Unforeseen circumstances beyond my control can still arise.
3. Everything's straightforward until people get involved. The more people there are, the more complicated it gets.
4. As a social being, I don't always find peace or comfort around others. Sometimes I feel more at ease in solitude.
5. I used to think that simply doing work aligned with our desires would be enough to make us happy. But I've realized that work is also about who we work with. The culture and the people we work alongside play a huge role in our happiness at work. When neither fits well with the worker, it reduces the happiness.
6. It's better to delay gratification for a better future than to seek temporary pleasure or external validation.
7. Paying attention to sadness can help us understand what we truly value, what's important to us, and what we deeply care about.
8. If we get the opportunity to lead, it's important to ensure that everyone feels included and to trust them without underestimating their abilities. Failing to involve others and micromanaging them is disrespectful to those who aspire to grow.
